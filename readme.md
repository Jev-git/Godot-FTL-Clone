# Doing
Player shield.
# Things to keep in mind
* This project is to learn new skills, not to have a full game/clone.
* Scope: 1 month (August 2021).
* Good enough can go a long way, especially in game development/learning.
* Fuck the graphic, we focus on mechanic first.
* Maybe crossout the item in checklist in stead of deleting them :)
# What to make
* A functional prototype of FTL, with incremental features.
# Minimal viable product
* Your ship on the left, enemy ship on the right, both with Hull HP.
* Both ship has weapons and shield.
* ~~Your ship can charge a weapon and fire on a room the enemy ship.~~
* ~~Enemy ship can charge a weapon and fire on a room on your ship.~~
* Game over and a reset button.
# Check list
* Basic combat: able to shoot at enemy
    * Enemy is an empty ship, no shield, no crews and do not fight back.
    * Our ship also only has a gun.
    * Enemy ship has HP.
    * Pause feature.
* Able to FTL jump to the next star (basically reload the combat scene).
* Add shield to enemy ship.
* Add shield to our ship, and weapon to enemy ship, and HP to our ship.

* Add dodge and miss chance.
* Add system damage.
